# SportMeet
The intent of this application is to give people an avenue to become more involve in team sports, and to connect people in local areas who enjoy playing similar games.  This app will serve a valuable purpose because it can be very frustrating to organize a pickup game of basketball, football, soccer, et cetera, when you do not have enough players, or the right location.  This app allow players to enter a game and allow other players in the area to find the game and join.

We hope that our app will assist in bring people and communities together by channeling the power of the internet to bring people together in person with a little competition. 

From us at SportMeet, LLC, we present out app, SportMeet.
